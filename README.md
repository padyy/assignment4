# Manual 

You can start the program by running the module named: ''main.py''. It will automatically execute the program and it 
	 will guidline you through comments and titles.
	 The package includes 7 modules:
	 context.py, main.py, strategy.py, u_i.py, bubblesort_assignment.py, bucketsort_assignment.py and quicksort_assignment.py

	 context is for context of strategy plan.It has valuable functions that are used also in sorting algorithms.
	 main is the main functionality of program.
	 strategy is for the strategies of strategy plan.
	 u_i is for u_i(user interface) and static methods.
	 bubblesort_assignment is for the implementation of bubblesort algorithm.
	 bucketsort_assignment is for the implementation of bucketsort algorithm.
	 quicksort_assignment is for the implementation of quicksort algorithm.

	 Some of the functions into the strategy.py , context.py and u_i.py are not used for this assignment, but they were used in
	 assignment 3.Since assignment 4 is following assignment 3, i left them for clarity purpose. U_i particularly is used only 
	 for the static method "divider" for u_i purpose.

SOS	 If you are using the Vs code, it has by default limit to output of terminal to 1000 lines. Please change it in settings to
	 10000 lines so you can see the whole output of my program.
	 I added a photo with a printscreen of the change in settings. You can do this by following the path below:
	 File-->Preferences-->settings : type in the search bar of settings scrollback and change the value of terminal to 10000
	 lines.

	 Thank you for your time. In advance, 
	 Pantelakis Ioannis
